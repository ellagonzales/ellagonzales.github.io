                                    <h2><a href="#">Projects</a></h2>

											<h2><a>PORCH Mobile App</a></h2>
											<img class="image fit" src="images/porch.png">
											I serve as the team lead for a 10-person cross-functional group developing an iOS app for <a href="https://porchcommunities.org/">PORCH</a>, a grassroots hunger relief nonprofit. Working closely with PORCH's founder, I conduct user interviews, collaborate on Figma designs, and oversee an agile development process. Our goal is to create a user-centric MVP that streamlines food donation collection, aligns with stakeholder needs, and advances PORCH's mission to combat food insecurity. This app is one of several projects <a href="https://appteamcarolina.com/">App Team Carolina</a> maintains in production, and I look forward to continuing my work on this team throughout my time at UNC.

											<h2><a>UNC CS Experience Labs: Open Hours Editor</a></h2>
											<img class="image fit" src="images/figma.png">
											I served as the UI/UX designer, product manager, and front-end developer for a new operating hours editor that seamlessly integrated with the existing <a href="https://csxl.unc.edu/welcome">UNC CS Experience Labs site</a>. By leading the user research, wireframing, and Figma design (pictured above) components of the four-person team project, my team and I enhanced administrative scheduling efficiency. Recognized as the best design out of 100+ student projects, this feature was officially adopted and integrated into the platform.

											Embark on your journey to find the “purrfect” pet with Whisker, an iOS adoption app built using the RescueGroups API and recognized with “Best UI/UX Design.” As the UI/UX Designer, Product Manager, and Front-End Developer, I implemented a swipe-to-save feature, integrated MVVM and local storage, and enabled light/dark modes for an intuitive user experience. Users can filter pets by zip code and radius, view detailed animal profiles, and easily manage saved favorites. This project was the culminating end-of-semester effort during my second semester in App Team Carolina's iOS Apprenticeship Cohort, where I defined the project roadmap, designed the logo, and led team scrum meetings to deliver a polished, engaging MVP.

											<h2><a>Weather App</a></h2>
											<img class="image fit" src="images/weatherapp.png">
											I created a feature-rich weather app, closely recreating Apple's Weather App, as the culminating end-of-semester project in App Team Carolina's iOS Academy, marking the conclusion of my first semester on the team. The app displays the current temperature, an hourly and 10-day forecast (with relevant icons), air quality levels, UV index, and sunrise/sunset times—each illustrated with interactive gradients. It also includes a toggle-based reporting system for inaccuracies, a “Report an Issue” view, and user notifications. This project demonstrates my commitment to detail-oriented UI design and user-focused functionality, delivering an intuitive, engaging weather experience.
