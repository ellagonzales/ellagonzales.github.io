							<h2><a href="#">Experience</a></h2>
							<p>
								<h3><a>Relevant Coursework</a></h3>
								My coursework spans essential topics in Computer Science and Business, including Software Engineering and Design Process, Data Structures and Algorithms, Corporate Finance, and Marketing. These courses have equipped me with foundational technical and analytical skills, preparing me for both software engineering and product management roles.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h3><a>Technical Skills</a></h3>
								I have experience in Python, Java, Swift, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, and skilled in tools like GitHub, Xcode, Figma, and Visual Studio Code. These skills form the foundation of my work in both iOS development and cross-functional team collaboration.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h3><a>Microsoft - Explorer Intern (Product Manager & Software Engineer)</a></h3>
								During my internship on the Throttling and Monetization Team within OneDrive and SharePoint Core, I developed an IP blocking and throttling feature in C# to mitigate DDoS attack impacts. I led customer interviews, collaborated with PMs and engineers, and created a comprehensive product roadmap, including launch and telemetry research to track key metrics. This role reinforced my passion for user-focused solutions and technical problem-solving.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h3><a>App Team Carolina - Product Manager</a></h3>
								Currently, I am the Product Manager for a mobile app project with PORCH, a hunger relief non-profit. I coordinate with cross-functional teams, conduct user interviews, and meet regularly with stakeholders to ensure alignment with community needs. This experience has deepened my skills in project coordination, user-centered design, and strategic communication.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h3><a>UNC Department of Computer Science - Teaching Assistant</a></h3>
								As a TA for the COMP110 introductory course, I guide over 600 undergraduates in mastering Python fundamentals and using GitHub for version control. I conduct one-on-one sessions, assist with debugging, and lead workshops that emphasize Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I also mentor new TAs and collaborate with the professor to develop teaching materials and practice problems, helping students build confidence and technical skills.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h3><a>UpCycle Creations - Founder and Owner</a></h3>
								I founded UpCycle Creations, a sustainable fashion venture focused on designing and selling custom upcycled clothing. With over $1,000 in net profit, this project combines my creative and business skills to promote conscious consumerism and sustainability.
