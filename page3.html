                                        <h3><a>COMP110 Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</a></h3>
                                        As a COMP110 Undergraduate Teaching Assistant at UNC's Department of Computer Science, I am driven by a passion for tutoring and my love for computer science. My aim is to inspire and guide fellow students on their computer science journey, particularly those who find the field initially daunting. In this role, I provide invaluable support to a class of 600 undergraduates, offering one-on-one teaching sessions to facilitate their understanding of Python fundamentals. My responsibilities encompass tutoring over 40 students weekly, assisting them in debugging code, and teaching effective coding techniques. Moreover, I guide students in utilizing GitHub for version control, fostering collaboration, enhancing code management skills, and applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in their coding projects. My close collaboration with the professor involves co-creating practice problems, developing engaging lecture ideas, and assessing programming assignments. It is my commitment to empowering others to thrive in the world of computer science.
