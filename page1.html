									<img src="images/headshot.jpg" alt="Headshot" class="image fit" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">
									<p></br>Hi! üëãüèº I'm Ella Gonzales, a junior at UNC Chapel Hill, double majoring in <a href="https://cs.unc.edu/">Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://www.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/programs/undergraduate-business/">Business Administration</a>. Originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, I've found a home in the intersection of tech, business, and design, all driven by my passion for bridging access to quality education and uplifting others. I love user-centered design and creative problem-solving, and I'm constantly seeking new ways to build meaningful products and communities. <br><br>
										On campus, I serve as a teaching assistant for UNC's introductory computer science course, helping students develop Python fundamentals and discover a love for coding. I'm also a Product Manager and Team Lead for <a href="https://appteamcarolina.com/">App Team Carolina</a>, where we're building a mobile application for <a href="https://porchcommunities.org/">PORCH</a>, a hunger-relief nonprofit. Here, I get to collaborate with engineers, iOS developers, and designers‚Äîtaking on various roles whenever needed. In previous semesters, I honed my Swift fundamentals as an iOS developer, which now informs my perspective as a Product Manager.<br><br>
										I'm especially proud to be one of the founding members of UNC's <a href="https://shpe.org/">Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers</a> (SHPE) chapter, where I currently serve as Marketing Director. In that role, I amplify resources online, design chapter apparel, and help fellow Hispanic/Latinx students break into tech while building a tight-knit community. Beyond campus, I've been fortunate to participate in professional development programs such as <a href="https://mlt.org/career-prep/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAy8K8BhCZARIsAKJ8sfRdsEQDiEbAL2a0tqUFy6mnzFtjjOYrdkPILq7zPasju67I5F16-gAaAt9oEALw_wcB">Management Leadership for Tomorrow's Career Prep</a> and <a href="https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/events/latinxstudentleadershipsummit">Google's 2024 Latinx Student Leadership Summit</a>‚Äîboth of which have allowed me to grow personally and professionally, while forging incredible friendships along the way.<br><br>
										During the summer of 2024, I interned at Microsoft through their <a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/v2/global/en/exploremicrosoft">Explore Internship Program</a>, where I split my time as a Software Engineer and Product Manager. This gave me firsthand experience in the full product development cycle‚Äîfrom ideation to launch‚Äîand I wrapped up the program by delivering a project aimed at mitigating <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/">DDoS attacks</a>. Tackling such an impactful challenge helped me sharpen both my technical and strategic skills.<br><br>
										Outside of classes and work, I stay active by hitting the gym, hiking, and occasionally surfing when I'm back home in California. I also play the guitar and enjoy mentoring other students. One of my ongoing passions is <a href="https://www.habitat.org/stories/what-is-upcycling">upcycling</a>‚Äîwhat began as a high school side hustle has become a creative outlet that encourages a more sustainable lifestyle.<br><br>
										All these experiences have shaped who I am today and solidified my commitment to growth‚Äîboth personally and professionally. I believe stepping outside your comfort zone is key to unlocking new opportunities and deeper connections, and I'm excited to continue challenging myself, exploring new possibilities, and using technology to create positive change.
