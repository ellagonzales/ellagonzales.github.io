                                    <h2><a href="#">About Me</a></h2>
									<p>Hello! I'm Ella Gonzales, a second-year student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, originally hailing from the San Francisco Bay Area in California. My journey into the world of Computer Science began with an introductory programming course in my freshman year, and it quickly became a passion. I'm now a teaching assistant for that course, aiming to inspire fellow students to embrace computer science, overcome obstacles, and combat imposter syndrome.</br></br>

                                        My academic path has been shaped by a strong commitment to utilizing technology and business for positive societal change. I firmly believe that education is the bedrock of a just society, and I am dedicated to enhancing access to quality education for all. My curiosity in the tech industry has led me to explore both Software Engineering and Product Management, where I'm driven by the creative problem-solving inherent in software engineering and the user-focused strategy of product management.</br></br>
                                        
                                        My experiences have illuminated the transformative potential of technology-driven education, particularly in leveling the playing field for underserved students worldwide. I aspire to develop applications and innovative projects that tackle real-world issues, such as improving access to quality education and addressing other societal challenges through coding.</br></br>
                                        
                                        Outside of my academic pursuits, I find creative fulfillment in upcycling clothes and customizing shoes, with the goal of inspiring others to reimagine their belongings and contribute to a more sustainable consumer society. 
                                        
                                        </p>
